Codemit is a Telegram-first AI Business Assistant built to help small and medium businesses automate their daily operations without introducing complexity.

The product focuses on automating customer communication, appointment booking, and reminders directly inside Telegram — the tool businesses already use.

Codemit is not a generic SaaS platform. It is a focused, practical system designed to remove manual work, reduce no-shows, and improve customer experience.

## Problem Statement

Many small businesses rely on Telegram to communicate with customers, yet they manage bookings manually:

- conversations are scattered
- bookings are tracked by hand
- reminders are forgotten
- no-shows are common

Existing solutions are either too complex, too expensive, or not aligned with how these businesses actually operate.

## Target Users

Codemit targets small and medium businesses that:

- already use Telegram as a primary communication channel
- offer appointment-based services
- prefer simple tools over complex dashboards

Initial focus:

- tutors and teachers
- beauty salons and barbers
- clinics and individual practitioners
- fitness coaches
- local service providers

## Product Mission

Codemit’s mission is to save time for business owners by automating repetitive tasks and allowing them to focus on delivering their service.

If a task can be automated safely, Codemit should handle it.
